# ML4MC


In this Repo, we will work with Jupyter notebooks and the data taken from https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0385-y 
This data set will be the main source of training and testing for a ML model for the ML4MC summer school 2021 where we aimed to investigated how properties can be determined using machine learning to deepen our understanding of spectroscopic species.
